# Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn

Seaborn is a very useful data visulization library of python. This small guided project gives a nice introduciton to seaborn via a hands-on
approach using [Ryhme](https://rhyme.com/). Guided porjects is an intresting new experiment by Coursera and I think it is a good one.

## New Learned Concepts
- The main effort in seaborn is converting your data into pandas datafarme. 
- Similar to box plots, violin plots are also a very useful tool for visulization of distributions. 
- Many seaborn plot functions take long format of data. pd.melt can be use to 'melt' a data from wide to long format.
