## Practice 1: Write a Practice Email

Write a practice email of introduction before continuing with the course. This is an optional task, but it is highly recommended. If you already posted an introduction of yourself on the discussion board, you can skip this activity OR you can write an introduction about the company/organization you are in. 

Try and apply as much of the information you learned in this lesson. 

This introduction email will be used for editing and comparison purposes in a later module, so make sure you save a copy of this on your computer or mobile device. Good luck!

## Homework 4: 

For this assignment, you will write the email text for an email that needs to apologize as well as make a request in a professional way. This time, you are helping a person named Martina Silva. First, let's look at the situation Martina is in:

Martina's Situation
Martina has a business partner named Carl in England. In her last email to Carl, Martina asked for the signatures of Carl’s bosses so that she could finalize their business deal. However, Martina forgot to attach the documents that needed to be signed to her email message. One of the main issues is that the deadline for the deal is coming soon, so she needs to write a request/apology email to Carl as soon as possible.

What type of information and language do you need to use to write the email text for this situation? Based on what you learned in this module, write one paragraph for Martina to use in her email. Your paragraph should include the following:

Organization & Content
An apology for Martina's mistake (not attaching the documents to the email message)
A request for Carl to explain the situation to his superiors
A request for Carl to send the signatures as soon as possible. 
Language Use
Accurate punctuation throughout the paragraph
Accurate capitalization throughout the paragraph
Polite language use throughout the paragraph

### Answer
Subject: Apology for Missing  Documents
I'm sorry that I have not attached documents with our recent email. Would you mind explaining this situation to your superior. Could you also try to do it as soon as possible as the deadline is approaching fast.

Thank you for understanding.

Over the past several weeks, we have looked at many different ways to improve your overall email communication. You improved your English writing skills, and your understanding of professional email communication. In this last module, you looked at how to be more culturally aware of your readers. So for this final assignment, take a moment to think about what you learned and write yourself an email about where you started and  how much you've improved. This will be a great opportunity for you to review everything you learned and focus on the main **takeaways** from this course.

You will need to include all 4 parts to a professional email (i.e. the subject line, the greeting, the email text, and the closing). The email text needs to include the following information:

- Your native language and country of origin
- The communication style of your culture. In other words, is it a low-context or a high-context communication culture?
- One thing other people need to remember when they write to people in your country.
- Three most important things to remember when writing a professional email
- The best advice you received through this course

Your email to yourself will be reviewed by 3 other members in this course. You will also get the opportunity to see how others have written to themselves and give them feedback as well.

**takeaway: conclusions, impressions, or action points***

##### Review criteria 

For this assignment, you will need to write an email to yourself with all 4 parts to an email (i.e. the subject line, the greeting, the email text, and the closing). The email text needs to include the following information:

- Your native language and country of origin
- The communication style of your culture. In other words, is it a low-context or a high-context communication culture?
- One thing other people need to remember when they write to people in your country.
- Three most important things to remember when writing a professional email 
- The best advice you received through this course

#### Answer

**Subject Line**: What I have Learned about Professional Emails

Dear Future Me, 

​							I hope you are doing well and staying safe. How is the weather in your current city of residence? It is quite random here in Hong Kong. How about the pandemic in the future? The situation is out of control in this gloomy present. 

I am writing this email to describe what I have learned during the course on professional email writing. The courses consisted of five modules: basic structure of emails, common language mistakes, announcements, and introductory emails, request and apology emails, and cultural considerations. 

Although I have learned many interesting things,  you may consider the following three to be most useful while writing professional emails. First, the basic structure of the email. An email consists of a subject line, greetings, body, and closing. This will help you organize your emails better. 

Second, keep cultural differences in mind while writing emails. Pakistan has a high-context culture and we are used to writing long messages in Urdu with a lot of formalities. This style is okay for high-context cultures (e.g. Asia, Middle East). However, it is maybe counter-productive in low-context cultures (e.g. USA, Canada, Europe). 

Third, apology and request emails need to be extra polite. You may not want to put blame on the other party. The number of requests per email may not be more than two per email.

The best and most actionable advice from this course is on writing an effective subject line. You may want to reflect (summarize) what you want in the subject line with action words and using less than 50 letters. Keep in mind that subject should be catchy to grab the attention of the reader who may not, otherwise, have time to read your email. 

Final comments: it is worthwhile to remember that a long personal email is more effective in Pakistan. However, it may offend a person from a low-context culture. 

Thank you for reading this long email. I hope this will be useful to you. Please stay safe and happy.



Best Regards, 

Awais
