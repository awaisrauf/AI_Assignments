It consists in rescaling our value of interest by deducting the minimum value and dividing the result by the difference between the maximum and the minimum value. For example, to rescale student's weight data spanning from 160 pounds to 200 pounds, you subtract 160 from each student's weight and divide the result by 40 (200 - 160).\n",
