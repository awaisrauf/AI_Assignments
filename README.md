# Online Courses
This repository contains all the code and notes for Moocs (online courses) I have taken.
- [CS20SI: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research from Stanford University](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/)
- [Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera and deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
These series of courses teaches foundation of deep learning with assignments.
  - [Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
  - [Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network)
  - [Course 4:Constitutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
