# Notes for Online Learning 
I love learning online - the joy of exploration with freedom and independence. I started my MOOC journety back in 2013 on Edx with Harvard's famous course [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/). A few years ago, I [found that by writing and sharing my progress, I am able to do things more efficentiy](http://deepawais.com/deepCuriosity/AI-RoadMap). Hence, to make my online journey more useful, I have started taking notes. This repo contains things for the courses that I have completed.
