# Chapter 2: Linear Algebra

- $$A^-1$$ should not be used for practical purposes as digital computers have limited precision. 

- In order for A^-1 to exits, x=A^-1b should have exactly one solution. However, A^-1 can have no or infinitely many solutions for some values of b. It is not possible that x=A^-1b have less than infinitely solutions.

- If x and y are solutions of Ax=b, then for any real number a, following is the solution;
  $$
  z = \alpha x + (1-\alpha)y
  $$

- Ax=b have a solution for all b \in R^m if **column space of A is R^m**. Example: Assume a 3x2 matrix, the b is 3-D vector. 3x2 matrix is  a slice of 3-D plane so we have exact solution iff b lies on the same 2-D plane. 

- **For solution to exist( column space of A to be m)**: n>=m and all there should be a set of m mutually linearly independent columns (rank(A)>=m). For inversion of A, it should also be square. 

- **Norms**: 

  - A norm is function mapping of a vector to a non-negative number.
  -  Square of L2 norm is easy to work with due to its properties e.g. derivative of  square of l2 norm w.r.t. an element of x is only dependent on that element while for l2 norm it is dependent on the entire vector. 
  - Square of l2 norm increases slowly around origin so it may not be useful in some problems. In that cases, L1 norm can be used which increase by e whenever any element of vector x moves by e. 

- Diagonal matrix are useful because of cheap computation. 

- Symmetric matrix (A=A.T) often arise when entries of matrix are generated by a function that don't depend on their order. E.g. if A is distance between point i and j then Ai,j = Aj,i. 

- **Decomposition**: 

  - We can decompose matrix to show functional properties that is not obvious from its original representation. 

  - Eigen vector is non-zero vector that upon multiplication with A gives scaled v i.e. Av = l.v where l is a scalar called eigen value. 

  - We can decompose A=V. dig(l_i) V^-1.

- Every symmetric matrix A has eigen value decomposition. 

- **Singular Value Decomposition** 

  - Every real matrix has an SVD.
