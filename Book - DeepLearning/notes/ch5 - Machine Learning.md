# Machine Learning Basics 

- Deep learning is a specific kind of machine learning and :

  > Machine learning is essentially a form of applied statistics with increased emphasis on the use of computers to statistically estimate complicated functions and a decreased emphasis on proving confidence intervals around these functions.

-  A computer program is said to learn from Experience E on class of Task T if it improves on Performance Metric P with the experience. 

- >From a scientific and philosophical point of view, machine learning is interesting because developing our understanding of it entails developing our understanding of the principles that underlie intelligence.  

### Task T

A task in ML is how machine learning algorithm should process an example. The process of learning is not task. Learning is the ability to attaining the ability to perform the task T. 

#### Classification 

To which category in $k$ categories do an input belong. In other words, we want to learn a function $y=f(x)$: $f: x \in \R^n \to {1,2,..., k}$. The algorithm may output category or distribution over categories. 

#### Classification with Missing Inputs
